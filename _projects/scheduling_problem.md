<p class="standard-text">
  Scheduling problems occur in different forms and shapes:
  optimizing load balancing in servers, planning optimal delivery routes of freight, or
  stocking warehouses to ensure flawless production chains. We have experience in translating such business
  requirements into mathematical optimization problems, and to solve them using
  powerful software frameworks and metaheuristic optimization methods. Furthermore, large scale scenarios
  are challenging due to the NP-hardness of the underlying problem.
  We use our machine learning expertise to reduce the problem complexity, which allows for development of
  more efficient solvers.
