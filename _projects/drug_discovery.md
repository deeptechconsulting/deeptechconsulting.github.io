<p class="standard-text">
  Drug discovery describes the discipline of identifying new drugs to fight diseases
  through a series of preclinical and clinical trial studies. Drug candidates
  are being evaluated after each study phase, and promising drugs are being tested
  in subsequent rounds. Due to modern laboratory standards and advances such as high-throughput screening,
  a large number of potential drugs may be tested in initial study phases. This calls for (partially) automated
  evaluation of test results. We have experience in building automated evaluation pipelines,
  which significantly simplify the candidate selection, especially during early study phases.
