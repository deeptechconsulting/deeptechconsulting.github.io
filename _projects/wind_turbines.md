We developed the open-source software <a href="http://www.opentidalfarm.org/">OpenTidalFarm</a> for simulating and optimising tidal turbine farms.
The positioning of the turbines in a tidal farm is a crucial decision. Simulations show that the optimal positioning can increase the power generation of the farm by up to 50% and can therefore determine the viability of a project. However, finding the optimal layout is a difficult process due to the complex flow interactions. OpenTidalFarm solves this problem by applying an efficient optimization algorithm onto an accurate flow prediction model.
