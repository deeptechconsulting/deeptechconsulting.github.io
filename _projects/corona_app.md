<p class="standard-text">
The Corona disease took over the world by storm in 2020 and caused high uncertainty
in almost every aspect of our daily lives. Quickly, most countries developed
technology in the form of mobile tracking apps,
or registration apps to limit the spread of the disease and ease the burden on society.
As part of the ETL and data analytics team of the Norwegian Corona App Smittestopp,
we helped to develop a backend system, which informed health authorities about the spread of the disease
based on recorded geospatial and bluetooth data.
